            <h3><b><i>The Maratha Navy was thus a pathbreaking venture on the part of Shivaji Maharaja, aimed at warding off the Portuguese, the British, and the Siddhis while helping his forces secure a hold over the Konkan coast, where there was a good prospect of maritime trade. Notably, he recognized the strategic importance of coastal defense and thus built a few naval forts like Sindhudurg and Vijaydurg. He also commissioned a fleet of warships, including Gurabs and Gallivats manned with experienced local sailors. His navy disrupted European dominance in the Arabian Sea, safeguarded maritime trade, and protected his kingdom against invasions. The foresight of Shivaji gave the first Indian indigenous navy, which gave a legacy that lasted in naval warfare and coastal defense.
